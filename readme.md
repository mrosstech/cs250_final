Submission for Section 8.2 of CS-250

Q1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The shape of the software will absolutely come from the needs of the users consuming the software.   The way the Product Owner translates these needs to the development team is through user stories.   They break the work down into small enough sections to complete several of them in a sprint and because of their small size they can be easily prioritized and re-prioritized without losing too much work

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I typically approach programs in a very agile way.   I usually start with a manual mock-up to verify that my idea will work.   Then I start to codify that manual work into code.   I think I could bring more of the retrospective into my process to help improve the process in the future.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Trust is the most important thing in being a good team member.  If the development team or scrum team, or any team for that matter doesn't have trust, it's not something that can be fixed through management pressure or regulations.
